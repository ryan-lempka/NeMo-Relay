# Migrate From NeMo Flow To NeMo Relay

Use this skill when a user has existing NeMo Flow code or documentation and
wants it converted to NeMo Relay. Treat the migration as a mechanical rename
plus language-specific validation, not a behavior rewrite.

## Default Workflow

1. Inspect the working tree and identify touched surfaces: Rust, Python,
   Node.js, Go, C FFI, CLI/config, docs, or integrations.
2. Resolve `SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory containing this `SKILL.md` and
   `TARGET_PATH` to the source repository or target project. Run the bundled
   helper in dry-run mode before editing:
   `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate_from_nemo_flow.py" "$TARGET_PATH" --rename-paths`
3. Review the reported text edits and path renames. If the scope is correct,
   rerun with `--write --rename-paths`.
4. Apply language-specific cleanup for package manager lockfiles, generated
   artifacts, and public API examples.
5. Search for remaining Flow names and verify the affected language surfaces.

## Mechanical Rename Map

- Brand and repository: `NeMo Flow` -> `NeMo Relay`,
  `NeMo-Flow` -> `NeMo-Relay`
- Python: `nemo-flow` -> `nemo-relay`, `nemo_flow` -> `nemo_relay`,
  `python/nemo_flow` -> `python/nemo_relay`
- Rust: `nemo-flow` -> `nemo-relay`, `nemo-flow-adaptive` ->
  `nemo-relay-adaptive`, `nemo_flow::` -> `nemo_relay::`
- Node.js: `nemo-flow-node` -> `nemo-relay-node`, including related entry
  points such as `/typed`, `/plugin`, `/adaptive`, and `/observability`
- Go: `github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Flow/go/nemo_flow` ->
  `github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Relay/go/nemo_relay`, package aliases
  `nemo_flow` -> `nemo_relay`, and source directories `go/nemo_flow` ->
  `go/nemo_relay`
- C FFI: `nemo_flow.h` -> `nemo_relay.h`, `nemo_flow_*` ->
  `nemo_relay_*`, `NemoFlow*` -> `NemoRelay*`, and `NEMO_FLOW_*` ->
  `NEMO_RELAY_*`
- CLI/config: `nemo-flow` -> `nemo-relay`, `.nemo-flow` -> `.nemo-relay`,
  `~/.config/nemo-flow` -> `~/.config/nemo-relay`, `NEMO_FLOW_*` ->
  `NEMO_RELAY_*`, and `x-nemo-flow-*` -> `x-nemo-relay-*`

Do not replace bare `flow`, `Flow`, or `FlowError`. Those can be domain words
or intentional compatibility names.

## Language Cleanup

- **Python**: update `pyproject.toml`, imports, type stubs, integration
  package paths, extras, and native module names. Regenerate or refresh lockfiles
  with the user's package workflow after source edits.
- **Rust**: update `Cargo.toml` crate names, workspace dependencies, package
  references, and `use nemo_relay::...` imports. Let Cargo regenerate
  `Cargo.lock` when dependencies changed.
- **Node.js**: update `package.json`, workspace names, package-lock entries,
  native addon artifact names, and imports from `nemo-relay-node`. Run the
  package manager to refresh locks.
- **Go**: update `go.mod`, import paths, package declarations, aliases, and any
  local directory layout under `go/nemo_relay`.
- **C FFI**: update header includes, exported symbol names, status and callback
  type names, macro constants, loader paths, and downstream bindings.
- **Docs and examples**: update badges, package install commands, repository
  links, hosted docs URLs, CLI commands, config paths, and integration names.

## Automation Helper

Use `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate_from_nemo_flow.py` for first-pass edits. The
helper:

- runs as a dry run unless `--write` is passed
- skips common vendor, build, cache, and generated directories
- skips lockfiles unless `--include-lockfiles` is passed
- can report or perform path renames with `--rename-paths`
- rewrites only explicit NeMo Flow identifiers, package names, repository names,
  config paths, headers, environment variables, and FFI type prefixes

Set shell-safe absolute paths before invoking the helper. Replace the example
values with the resolved skill directory and either the source repository or the
user's target project:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="/resolved/absolute/path/to/nemo-relay-migrate-from-flow"
TARGET_PATH="/resolved/absolute/path/to/target-project"

python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate_from_nemo_flow.py" "$TARGET_PATH" --rename-paths
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/migrate_from_nemo_flow.py" "$TARGET_PATH" --write --rename-paths
```

Use `--include-lockfiles` only when the user wants lockfiles edited directly;
otherwise regenerate them with Cargo, uv/pip, npm, or Go tooling.

## Verification

- Search for remaining explicit Flow identifiers:
  `rg -n "NeMo Flow|NeMo-Flow|nemo_flow|nemo-flow|NEMO_FLOW|NemoFlow|nemo_flow\\.h|nemo_flow_"`
- Run targeted tests for every affected language surface.
- For Rust changes, run `cargo test` or the repository's Rust test recipe.
- For Python changes, run the relevant import check and tests in the target
  environment.
- For Node.js changes, run package install, type checks, and package tests.
- For Go changes, run `go test ./...` from the updated module.
- For docs-only migrations, build or link-check docs if the site navigation,
  install commands, or API references changed.
