# Export ATIF Trajectories

Use this reference when the user wants execution traces as ATIF documents rather than
live OTLP spans.

## Default Path

- Create an `AtifExporter` with session and agent metadata
- Register it before the instrumented work
- Run scoped tool and LLM activity
- Call `export()` or `export_json()`
- Clear between runs and deregister when done

## Embedded ATIF Semantics

- ATIF export translates NeMo Relay events into ATIF v1.7 trajectory data.
- LLM start events become `user` steps; message content is extracted from the
  `LLMRequest.content` payload when possible.
- LLM end events become `agent` steps with response content, model metadata,
  token metrics, reasoning fields, and promoted `tool_calls` when the response
  uses a supported tool-call shape.
- Tool start events are skipped in the trajectory because tool calls are
  promoted from the preceding LLM end response.
- Tool end events become `system` observations. Observations are correlated to
  promoted tool calls by function name and source call ID when available.
- Mark events with data become `system` steps. Scope start/end events are
  structural and are not emitted as trajectory steps.
- Scope nesting becomes ancestry metadata on exported steps.
- Nested agent scopes become embedded `subagent_trajectories` with
  `subagent_trajectory_ref` observations in the parent trajectory.
- Event payloads become step input, step output, tool-call content, or
  observation content.
- The exporter preserves collected event order and uses lifecycle pairing to
  reconstruct the trajectory.
- Exporting does not clear the buffer. Use one exporter per run or call
  `clear()` between runs when concurrent agents share a process.
- Before using a trajectory in evaluation, confirm `schema_version` is
  `ATIF-v1.7`, agent metadata is correct, expected LLM/tool steps are present,
  tool observations follow tool calls, and sensitive fields are absent.

## Important Semantics

- ATIF exports the full event buffer collected so far.
- Consecutive tool observations can be merged into one system observation step.
- Trajectories reflect sanitized event payloads, not raw secrets that
  sanitize guardrails removed before event emission.
- Response codecs can improve LLM end annotations, but they do not change the
  caller-visible LLM response.

## Checklist

- [ ] Session and agent metadata chosen
- [ ] Exporter registered before the relevant run
- [ ] Scope boundaries are correct so ancestry is meaningful
- [ ] Export timing is clear: whole buffer vs clear-between-runs
- [ ] LLM responses include `tool_calls` if ATIF tool-call entries are expected
